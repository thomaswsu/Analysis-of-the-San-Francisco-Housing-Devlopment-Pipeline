The Housing Crisis in San Francisco has been a very contentious issue for the last few decades in the city. The trajectory of house prices in San Francisco have more than doubled in the last 10 years with no end in sight.  Many existing residents are being driven out of their homes and many are unable to move to the city because of its prohibitive entry price. Simply put, housing prices in SF are so high because demand far outstrips supply. The analysis of the San Francisco Development Pipeline is important to be able identify deficiencies in city planning to address this crisis. 

From analysis of the dataset, we discover that there is a strong correlation between the neighborhoods with development permits approved and income. We find that low-income neighborhoods have more housing permits approved and high-income neighborhoods have less housing permit approved. Additionally, our study identifies the most influential individuals to contact that have the largest influence of permit approval and permit submission.
